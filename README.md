### Base corner connector

This component holds the aluminum extrusions in the base together, and also allows for rubber to be attached underneath it. The purpose of the latter is to increase the resistance of the device against recoil during firing. The component features holes that can be used for securing aluminum extrusions using machine screws and T-nuts.

This part of the device consists of two aluminum corner brackets that attach to the "short half" of the catapult arm. These brackets are the points where the bungee cords attach, allowing for firing of the device.

This part of the device consists of a horizontal piece of aluminum extrusion mounted to the "long extrusions" of the tower on each end. This component serves as an anchoring point for the bungee cords.

### Bucket

The bucket consists of a 3D printed shuttle and a shallow plastic cup. The projectiles fired from the catapult will be placed in the plastic cup, which in itself is attached to the shuttle using hot glue. The bucket is not restricted to one position; the shuttle can be moved freely along the length of the "long half" of the catapult arm. It can be secured in a specific position using a machine screw and T-nut. 

### Catapult arm

The catapult arm rotates along with the threaded rod that is droven right through it. This rod seperates the arm into two sections: the "short" and "long" halves. 
This arm can be attached to the rest of the catapult by inserting the ends of the axle into the bearings of the "elbows" of the tower.
