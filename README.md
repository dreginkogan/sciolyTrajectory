### Base corner connector

This component holds the aluminum extrusions in the base together, and also allows for rubber to be attached underneath it. The purpose of the latter is to increase the resistance of the device against recoil during firing. The component features holes that can be used for securing aluminum extrusions using machine screws and T-nuts.

This part of the device consists of a horizontal piece of aluminum extrusion mounted to the "long extrusions" of the tower on each end. This component serves as an anchoring point for the bungee cords.

### Catapult arm

The catapult arm rotates along with the threaded rod that is droven right through it. This rod subdivides the arm into two sections: the "short" and "long" halves. 
On the short half are two aluminum corner brackets. These brackets are points where the bungee cords attach, allowing for the firing of the device. 
On the long half of the catapult arm is the bucket, which consists of a 3D printed shuttle and a shallow plastic cup. The projectiles fired from the catapult will be placed in the plastic cup, which is attached to the shuttle using hot glue. The bucket is not restricted to one position; the shuttle can be moved freely along the length of the "long half" of the catapult arm and secured in a specific position using a machine screw and a T-nut. 

This arm can be attached to the rest of the catapult by inserting the ends of the axle into the bearings of the "elbows" of the tower.

### Tower

The tower is the elevated portion of the catapult. It includes two "elbow" brackets, which serve as attachment points for the arm. 

The 4 longest aluminum extrusions within the tower have brackets at their ends, which allow for the assembly to be attached to the base.
