All the blue parts in the image are 3D printed, while the metallic-looking components are metal parts purchased from online. The black components in the image are rubber.

The device is assembled by first constructing its subassemblies. The subassemblies are the base, tower, and the arm. Once these are completed, they can be joined together, creating the catapult. As a launch mechanism, an additional aluminum corner bracket can be attached to the base of the device, which allows for a metal rod to be driven through it and the aluminum extrusion of the arm, temporarily cocking it back.

### Base corner connector

The base corner connector holds the aluminum extrusions in the base together. It also has rubber attached to its bottom, which helps increase resistance against recoil during firing.

### unnamed horizontal bar

This is a horizontal bar within the tower subassembly. It functions as a point of attachment for bungee cords, and is also the farthest position that the arm can be pulled back to.

### Tower

The tower is a "triangular" construction consisting of 3D printed brackets, aluminum brackets, aluminum extrusions, and bearings. It's overall purpose is to serve as an attachment point for the arm, which is elevated off the ground tso that it doesn't touch the floor while firing.

### Catapult arm

The catapult arm does the "throwing" in the catapult. It has an aluminum rod driven through it, that attached to bearings within the elbow joints of the tower.
On one end of the catapult are aluminum brackets, which serve as attachment points for bungee cords. On the other end of the arm, is a bucket whose position can be adjusted for different launch distances.

### Aluminum extrusions

Aluminum extrusions were used as a material within the catapult because of their strength, relatively low weight, and versatility from T-slots. They were joined together using aluminum and 3D printed brackets.
